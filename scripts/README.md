# GMT Dataserver Scripts

Here are all the scripts used to maintain the server and process
data files from the original sources.

**Note**: After a clean checkout (say, after a power outage or similar),
the hash table will not be rebuilt because fit fetch finds no new items.
In that case I had to add a comment like this to trigger the script.
